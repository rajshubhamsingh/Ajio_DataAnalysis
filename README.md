# 🛍️ AJIO EDA Data Analysis Project

A data-driven analytics project focused on **AJIO** — one of India's top fashion e-commerce platforms by Reliance. This project analyzes key aspects of AJIO's business using multiple datasets to uncover insights around customer behavior, pricing strategy, product distribution, and operational efficiency.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project uses Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) on Google Colab to explore and visualize structured e-commerce data. The data is sourced from multiple CSV files, each covering a specific part of the AJIO system:

### 📦 Dataset Files:
- `Order.csv` – Order-level data including quantities, values, and order dates  
- `Customer.csv` – Customer demographics and IDs  
- `Delivery.csv` – Delivery time and logistics details  
- `Product.csv` – Product-level metadata like brand, price, and category  
- `Rating.csv` – User-generated ratings  
- `Returns.csv` – Return orders and return reasons  
- `Transactive.csv` – Transaction details (payment mode, status, etc.)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Data Analysis & Cleaning)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Google Colab** (Notebook Development & Execution)
